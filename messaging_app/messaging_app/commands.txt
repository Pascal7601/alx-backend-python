This file contains the commands to install and configure the Nginx Ingress

controller for the Django application on a minikube cluster.

1. Install the Nginx Ingress controller

For minikube, this is done by enabling the 'ingress' addon.

minikube addons enable ingress

2. Apply the Ingress resource configuration

This command reads the ingress.yaml file and creates the Ingress resource

in your Kubernetes cluster, which sets up the routing rules.

kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml

3. Verify that the Ingress resource was created

kubectl get ingress

4. Access your application

To access the app using the hostname 'django-app.local', you need to

map the minikube IP to this hostname in your local machine's hosts file.

First, get the IP address of your minikube cluster:

minikube ip

Next, add an entry to your system's hosts file.

On macOS/Linux, this file is located at /etc/hosts

On Windows, it is at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

Add the following line, replacing MINIKUBE_IP with the actual IP from the command above:

MINIKUBE_IP   django-app.local

Now you can access your Django application in a web browser at:

http://django-app.local/
